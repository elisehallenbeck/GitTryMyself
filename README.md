# HEADER
I want to try to do the first steps of the demo by myself. I want to:

Create a repository on GitHub
Pull? it to my local machine
Make edits on my local machine in VS code to README
Create new file in VScode 
save those edits & new file and push? them to github

##EDIT TEST
Here I am adding this section to the README file.
These changes are not being tracked in git. Not sure why.
I changed the setting in VScode to autosave and now it is working.
